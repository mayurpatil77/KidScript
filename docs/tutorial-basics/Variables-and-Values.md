# Variables and Values


Imagine having magical boxes called **"variables."** These boxes can hold all sorts of things like numbers, words, and pictures!

### What Are Variables?

Let's say you have a robot friend who loves candies. You can create a variable called `candies` to keep track of how many candies your robot friend has. If your robot friend has 5 candies, you can store that number in the `candies` box!


```js title="Numbers"
candies = 5;
```

### Using Variables

Variables are like labels. Just like you label your toy box as "Toys," variables help us remember what's inside.

#### Different Types of Values

Things have different types, like numbers, words, and true or false. These are called "data types." 

Here are examples:

- **Numbers:** 7, 100, or 3.14.
- **Words:** Also called "strings." Like "hello", "robot", or "coding".
- **True or False:** Called "booleans." Like true or false.

## Storing Different Things

Robots have favorite colors too! Store your robot friend's favorite color in a variable:


```js title="Strings"
favoriteColor = "blue";
}
```
Or maybe your robot friend is happy:

```js title="Booleans"
isHappy = true;
}
```
### Changing Values

Remember your candies variable? 

Your robot friend can eat candies and the count changes:

``` js title="Chaning Values"
candies = candies - 1;
``` 

**Now your robot friend has 4 candies**

### Lets Recap 

Variables are like magic boxes holding different things. Numbers, words, and even your robot friend's emotions. 
By using variables, you can make your robot friend do all sorts of cool things in your code!

## Exploring Different Programming Languages

üåê Did you know that there are many different programming languages, just like there are many languages people use to talk with each other? Each programming language has its own special way of doing things!

### Learning New Words

Think of programming languages as special dictionaries. Just like you use a dictionary to learn new words in different languages, programmers use programming languages to talk to computers!

### Data Types in JavaScript

üìö Let's start with JavaScript! In JavaScript, we have different types of things we can store in our magical boxes (variables):

- **Numbers:** For counting and doing math.
- **Strings:** For words and sentences.
- **Booleans:** For saying "yes" or "no."

```javascript
numberBox = 10;  // Numbers
wordBox = "hello"; // Strings
booleanBox = true; // Booleans

```

### Data Types in C++

üîç Now, let's peek into C++! In C++, we also have special ways to store things:


###### Integers

Integers are whole numbers. Imagine you have a jar for storing marbles, and each marble is a whole number. 

In C++, we use the **int** keyword for these whole numbers.

```cpp
int marbles = 20; // The jar has 20 marbles
``` 

###### Strings

Strings are like words and messages. Think of them as a string of colorful beads that you can wear as a bracelet. 

In C++, we use the **string** keyword to store words.

```cpp

string myName = "Alice"; // Your name is now stored in a string!

```

###### Booleans

Booleans are for making decisions. It's like having a special light that can either be on (true) or off (false). 

We use the **bool** keyword to store these special decisions.


```cpp

bool isSunny = true; // The weather is sunny!

``````

üß† Remember, different programming languages might use different words to talk to computers, but they all help us make amazing things happen!

So whether you're using JavaScript, C++, or any other language, you're becoming a coding wizard who can talk to computers in their own special way!
