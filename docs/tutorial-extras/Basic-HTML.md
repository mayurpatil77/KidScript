# Basic HTML


🌟 Welcome to the world of web creation! Just like artists use colors and brushes to paint, web developers use HTML to build amazing web pages. Let's dive into the basics of HTML and start creating our own digital wonders!

### What Is HTML?

HTML is like the building blocks of a website. It's a special code that tells the computer how to show things on a web page. Just like using LEGO blocks to build cool structures, we use HTML to build web pages!

### Say Hello with Headings

🔤 Headings in HTML are like titles for your web page sections. They help you organize your page and show what each part is about. It's like giving names to different rooms in your digital house!

```html
<!-- Example -->
<h1>Welcome to My Awesome Website!</h1>
<h2>Discover Fun and Exciting Adventures</h2>
Pictures and Links: Adding Fun!
🖼️ You can make your web page even more exciting by adding pictures and links. Pictures are like decorations, and links are like secret doors that take you to other places on the internet.

```html
<!-- Example -->
<img src="unicorn.png" alt="A Happy Unicorn">
<a href="games.html">Play Fun Games!</a>
```
###### Making Lists: Ordering Things

📋 Lists help you organize information. You can make numbered lists or lists with bullet points. It's like writing down steps for a treasure hunt!

```html
<!-- Example -->
<h3>My Favorite Things</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pizza</li>
  <li>Rainbows</li>
  <li>Books</li>
</ul>
```
